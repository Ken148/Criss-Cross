This repository contains a Criss-Cross (Tic-Tac-Toe) game designed for learning purposes, where a player competes against the computer. The project was built to practice programming concepts such as game logic, basic AI for decision-making, and input handling. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the computer uses a simple algorithm to make its moves.

### Features

- 🎮 Player vs Computer: Play Criss-Cross against a computer opponent with predefined logic.
- 🛠 Learning-Oriented: A beginner-friendly project for learning game development and AI logic.
- 🤖 Computer Moves: The computer makes intelligent moves, trying to block or win when possible.
- 🎲 Game Logic: Includes win-checking, tie-checking, and alternating turns between the player and the computer.
- 🔁 Replayable: Play multiple rounds, with the option to restart after each match.
- 🖥 Command-Line Interface: Fully playable via the terminal/console.
