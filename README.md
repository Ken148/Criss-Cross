## Overview

This repository contains a Criss-Cross (Tic-Tac-Toe) game designed for learning purposes, where a player competes against the computer. The project was built to practice programming concepts such as game logic, basic AI for decision-making, and input handling. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the computer uses a simple algorithm to make its moves.

### Features
